    This abstract base class comprises the basic interface for quaternionic
    arrays, including the components (w, x, y, z), the parts (scalar, vector),
    the norm and absolute value, the normalized equivalent, and so on.  Also
    included are various

    The other main elements for a quaternionic array class are converters (to
    and from matrices, Euler angles, etc.)  and, of course, the algebraic
    functions (addition, multiplication, etc.).
